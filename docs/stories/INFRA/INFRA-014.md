<!-- If this story changes any documented architecture, add docs/architecture.md to the touches: list above. -->
## Requires
<!-- Prior stories, system state, or file conditions that must hold before building. -->

## Ensures
<!-- Binary assertions the reviewer checks independently. One per line.
     Each must be verifiable without interpretation: file exists, command output
     contains X, function Y returns Z. -->
<!-- State the correct signal AND the forbidden proxy (INFRA-314): e.g. "the
     write is absent after refusal; forbidden proxy: a warning line while the
     write happens anyway." -->
