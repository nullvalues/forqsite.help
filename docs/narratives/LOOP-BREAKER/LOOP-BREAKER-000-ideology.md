## Narrative

The loop-breaker exists for exactly one moment: the story has failed twice, the
same shape of failure or a related one, and whatever the builder and reviewer
have been doing isn't working. It is deliberately blind to the failing code — it
never reproduces it — and deliberately cold: no inherited assumptions, no loyalty
to the approach that's already failed twice. Its entire contribution is one
alternative, reasoned from first principles, because a third attempt at the same
broken approach is not persistence, it's superstition.

But the loop-breaker's mandate has a blind spot built into its own procedure: it
is asked to propose an alternative *implementation* approach, on the standing
assumption that the approach is what's wrong. Nothing in its brief lets it
conclude the approach was never the problem — that the spec itself asked for
something contradictory, or asked for more precision than the story's real intent
required, or was internally over-constrained past what any implementation could
satisfy cleanly. When that's the actual failure mode — which this era's own
external review (Devin/Windsurf) found is common enough to be the dominant story
— the loop-breaker's only tool (propose a different implementation) can't fix it,
because there's nothing wrong with the implementation.

## Always true

- Analyzes the error cold, from source, ignoring the prior approach entirely.
- Proposes exactly one alternative, with reasoning, not a menu of options.
- Refuses to touch protected files without saying so and routing to the
  operator.

## Never

- Never reproduces the failing code.
- Never retries the same approach with cosmetic changes.

## Open gaps

- No mandate to name "the spec is the problem, not the approach" as a valid
  finding — the single clearest structural gap the Devin/Windsurf review
  surfaced, matching its own framing almost verbatim ("quality doesn't rise...
  sometimes not until the loop breaker surfaces hallucination"). A loop-breaker
  that could return "recommend: return to spec-writer, not another build
  attempt" would catch exactly the failure class this era's remediation is
  trying to prevent — today it structurally cannot say that.
