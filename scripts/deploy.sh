#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# deploy.sh — deploy the two published bundles (index.html, gap-handoff.html) to the
# configured per-site directory, over the configured ssh alias, at a git ref.
#
# What it does:
#   - Resolves the git repository containing the current working directory.
#   - Reads deployment target configuration (ssh alias + remote directory) from the
#     environment, falling back to a gitignored scripts/deploy.env when unset. That file
#     is read as KEY=value data by read-deploy-env.sh (loaded from this script's own
#     directory), never executed (CER-024); a non-empty value in it overrides the
#     environment's, and any line that is not a KEY=value line for a known key is
#     refused (exit 2) by line number, without printing its content.
#   - Refuses to proceed, before any network contact, if either bundle is untracked at
#     the ref, or its working-tree or staged content differs from that ref ("dirty").
#   - Backs up each live bundle on the remote side to <name>.bak-<UTC stamp>, then
#     overwrites (never renames) each live bundle in place with the bytes of that
#     bundle at the given ref (default HEAD), then verifies each file's sha256 on the
#     far side against the same ref's bytes computed locally.
#   - After both bundles have been copied and hash-verified, generates a provenance
#     sidecar (scripts/make-provenance.sh --ref "$REF") and deploys it to
#     site-provenance.json using the same backup / overwrite-in-place / verify-sha256
#     sequence. The sidecar is written last, deliberately: it asserts "this commit is
#     deployed", and writing it before the bundles land would publish that claim even
#     if a later bundle copy then failed.
#   - Stages every remote write unpredictably (CER-023). Each file's bytes are streamed
#     into a stage created on the far side by `mktemp` in the remote directory (template
#     ./.<name>.deploy-XXXXXXXXXX: an unpredictable name, created exclusively), then
#     copied over the live file in place, and the stage is removed whether the steps
#     succeed or fail. A far side with no `mktemp` is a remote failure (exit 5). A file
#     that did not exist before is created mode 0644, so the web server's account can
#     read it; an existing file keeps its inode and its mode unchanged.
#   - Writes each backup with noclobber. <name>.bak-<stamp> is refused (exit 5) if that
#     name already exists in any form, including a dangling symlink; otherwise it is
#     written under `set -C`, so a name appearing between the check and the write makes
#     the write fail instead of following it.
#   - Bounds retention (CER-027). Only after both bundles and the sidecar have verified,
#     and never on any failure path, it writes a .deploy-verified-<stamp> marker (with
#     noclobber) and prunes verified backup sets beyond BACKUP_KEEP (a constant, below).
#     The set this deploy just made is always kept. A set without a marker — the
#     rollback copy of a deploy that failed verification, or a set older than this
#     retention scheme — is never pruned; remove such sets by hand when no longer
#     wanted. If pruning fails partway, the report names the stamps already pruned and
#     the one that failed.
#   - Precondition: the remote directory should be writable only by the deploy account.
#     The mktemp staging and noclobber backups narrow the symlink race another account
#     could run in that directory; they do not make a shared directory safe.
#   - Prints a pasteable success record. Never runs docker, docker compose, systemctl,
#     or any container/service restart — including for the one-time bind-mount this
#     script's sidecar requires. That mount (docker-compose.yml) and the container
#     recreate it needs are a one-time, documented, manual bootstrap: (a) run this
#     script once so site-provenance.json exists in the remote directory, (b) add the
#     mount, (c) recreate the container (`docker compose up -d`). Adding the mount
#     before step (a) makes Docker create a directory at that path instead of
#     bind-mounting a file, and the mount is then permanently wrong. Every deploy after
#     the one-time recreate is a plain copy, like the two bundles, and needs nothing
#     further.
#
# Usage:
#   deploy.sh [--ref <git-ref>] [--dry-run]
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  success
#   2  configuration missing or unreadable (FORQSITE_HELP_DEPLOY_HOST /
#      FORQSITE_HELP_DEPLOY_DIR unset, or scripts/deploy.env has a refused line), or
#      FORQSITE_HELP_DEPLOY_HOST does not match the ssh-alias pattern
#      ^[A-Za-z0-9._][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$ (letters, digits, ., _, -; may not begin with -)
#   3  dirty-tree refusal (untracked at the ref, or working tree / index differs)
#   4  hash verification failure (remote bytes do not match the ref's bytes)
#   5  transport/remote failure (ssh or a remote command failed; the remote has no
#      mktemp or sha256sum; a backup name already exists; or, after every file
#      verified, the marker or prune step failed — the message then says the files
#      verified and names any stamps pruned before the failure)
#
# Notes:
#   - nginx.conf is also bind-mounted into the container, but unlike the two bundles a
#     change to it needs a container action (e.g. a config reload) to take effect. That
#     is deliberately outside what this script does; this script only ever touches the
#     two bundle files.
#   - The remote bind mount follows the file's inode, not its name. Each bundle must be
#     overwritten in place (copied over the existing file), never replaced by renaming a
#     new file over it — a rename would leave the container serving the old, now-unlinked
#     inode while the deploy appeared to succeed.
#   - Transport errors never print the configured target (CER-028, INFRA-014). Every
#     ssh call is routed through run_ssh(), which captures ssh's own stderr and the
#     remote shell's stderr to a scratch file — never printed, whole or in part — and
#     a failure prints a fixed reason label instead (e.g. "the connection was
#     refused"). Interactive prompts (host-key questions, passwords,
#     keyboard-interactive) are unaffected: OpenSSH's read_passphrase() writes every
#     one of them to the controlling tty, not to stderr, even when stdin is a pipe.
#     The accepted cost is that server banners and the "Permanently added ... to the
#     list of known hosts" notice are no longer shown, on success or failure alike.
#     BatchMode=yes, -q and LogLevel=QUIET were all rejected: BatchMode disables every
#     prompt (breaking interactive authentication), and -q/LogLevel=QUIET suppress the
#     very messages the reason labels are derived from. No ssh option is added.
