#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# make-provenance.sh — prints, to stdout, a single JSON object recording which commit
# of this repository produced the two published bundles (index.html, gap-handoff.html)
# at a given git ref, and the sha256 of each bundle's bytes at that ref. It does
# nothing else: it reads no configuration, contacts no host, and writes to no file.
# scripts/deploy.sh calls this script and performs the transport of its stdout to
# site-provenance.json in the configured remote directory (see that script's header
# for the deploy-side sequence and ordering).
#
# What it does:
#   - Resolves the git repository containing the current working directory.
#   - Resolves the given ref (default HEAD) to its 40-char commit sha.
#   - Refuses, before printing anything, if either bundle is not tracked at the ref.
#   - Reads the ref's committer date (UTC) and the current UTC time.
#   - Computes the sha256 of each bundle's bytes at the ref via `git show <ref>:<bundle>`.
#   - Emits one JSON object with fixed key order (see docs/stories/INFRA/INFRA-008.md
#     § Decisions 1) using printf — no jq dependency, and none is needed because every
#     field in the fixed shape is a hex string, an ISO timestamp, an integer or a fixed
#     filename, so no field ever needs JSON string escaping.
#
# Usage:
#   make-provenance.sh [--ref <git-ref>]
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   success — the JSON object was printed to stdout
#   5   a bundle is not tracked at the given ref (named in the message)
#   64  usage error (unrecognised argument, or --ref given with no value)
#
# Notes:
#   - This script reads no configuration and contacts nothing. It is a pure function
#     of (repo, ref), which is what makes it testable against a throwaway fixture repo
#     with no fixture remote at all — see scripts/provenance-selftest.sh.
#   - The commit subject is deliberately not carried in the output: it is free-form
#     text and the only candidate field that would need escaping. Omitting it keeps
#     every value in the fixed shape.
