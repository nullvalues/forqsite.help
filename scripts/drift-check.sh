# drift-check.sh — compares the bytes an HTTP request actually returns for the two
# published bundles (index.html, gap-handoff.html) against the bytes committed at a
# git ref, and exits non-zero when they differ. This is the served-bytes half of
# INFRA-006's copy-and-verify: deploy.sh verifies that the bytes it copied landed on
# the remote file; this script verifies that a request against the live URL returns
# those same bytes. Neither check alone closes the gap CER-014 records: a rename over
# a bundle leaves the container's bind mount serving an old, now-unlinked inode while
# the file on the remote directory (and any mtime/size/process check of it) still
# looks correct. Hashing the remote file instead of the bytes a request returns is
# exactly the proxy this script refuses to take, because that proxy is the one that
# would pass over a stale inode.
#
# What it does:
#   - Resolves the git repository containing the current working directory.
#   - Reads the site's base URL from the environment, falling back to a gitignored
#     scripts/deploy.env when unset (the same file, and the same read pattern,
#     deploy.sh already uses for its own two variables).
#   - For each bundle: fetches <base-url>/<bundle> to a file (never a shell variable —
#     command substitution strips trailing newlines and would report a false DRIFT on
#     a correct site), with an identity content-encoding and no redirect following,
#     and hashes the fetched bytes with sha256.
#   - Computes sha256 of `git show <ref>:<bundle>` (default ref HEAD) for the same
#     bundle, and compares.
#   - On a mismatch, walks the commits reachable from the ref that touched that
#     bundle, hashing each distinct blob, to name which committed version (if any)
#     the served bytes actually match — because "the bytes differ" is a weaker report
#     than "the bytes differ, and the site is serving commit <X>".
#   - Also fetches <base-url>/site-provenance.json (INFRA-008) and reports it as a
#     labelled *claim* alongside the per-bundle result — never as part of the match
#     decision. The sidecar can only ever add a failure: its claimed per-bundle
#     sha256 values are compared against the bytes this run actually fetched, and a
#     disagreement is reported with its own exit code, reachable only when no bundle
#     drifted (drift's exit 3 always outranks it). It can never supply a match,
#     suppress one, or turn a DRIFT into an ok — trusting a version string out of the
#     sidecar as the basis of the decision is exactly the proxy this script exists to
#     refuse; a stale or hand-written sidecar would lie, and the site would look
#     current because it said so.
#   - Prints one report block. Exits 0 only when every bundle's served bytes match the
#     ref's bytes and the sidecar did not contradict them.
#
# Usage:
#   drift-check.sh [--ref <git-ref>]
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   no drift — every bundle's served bytes match the ref (the sidecar, if present,
#       agreed, or was absent/unreadable — never part of this decision either way)
#   2   configuration missing (FORQSITE_HELP_SITE_URL)
#   3   drift detected — at least one bundle's served bytes do not match the ref
#       (outranks 6: always the exit when both are true)
#   4   fetch failure (non-2xx, a redirect, a connection failure, a timeout, a refused
#       scheme — only http/https are permitted, so e.g. a file:// base URL is refused
#       rather than read as a local path — or a response that exceeded the configured
#       size bound)
#   5   a bundle is not tracked at the ref
#   6   provenance sidecar contradiction — the sidecar's claimed sha256 for a bundle
#       disagrees with that bundle's served bytes, and no bundle drifted (exit 3 takes
#       precedence whenever both conditions hold). This decision is always made on the
#       sidecar's raw extracted claim, never the sanitised display copy printed in the
#       report (INFRA-010) — a claim that merely *sanitises* to the correct hash still
#       disagrees on the bytes that were actually claimed.
#   64  usage error (unrecognised argument, or --ref given with no value)
#
# Notes:
#   - Byte-level only, never render-level. This check never parses, greps or renders
#     the fetched HTML for a version string, a phase marker, or any other content
#     signal, and never consults mtime or size. The only thing read out of the fetched
#     bytes is their sha256. A render-based or DOM-based check would inherit the fact
#     that the bundles' rendering is not exercised by any check in this tree today —
#     that gap belongs to a sibling content phase, not this one.
#   - nginx.conf is bind-mounted into the container alongside the two bundles, but
#     unlike them it is never served: no HTTP request returns its bytes (it only sets
#     `listen`, `server_name`, `root`, `index`), so the invariant this script checks is
#     undefined for it. This script prints one explicit line saying so in every report
#     rather than silently omitting the file, or checking it over ssh and presenting
#     that as if it carried the same strength — an ssh comparison would assert a
#     different, weaker invariant (the file on the host equals the committed file,
#     which is the very proxy this script refuses for the bundles) and would make ssh
#     reachability a precondition of a check that otherwise needs only an HTTP client.
#     That is a config-drift check, if one is ever wanted; it is not this one.
#   - This script never runs docker, docker compose, ssh or scp. It makes an HTTP
#     request, nothing else.
#   - curl's redirect-following is off by default; this script does not turn it on, so
#     a 3xx response is never followed. It is still explicitly detected as a fetch
#     failure below, because "the bytes this URL returns" is the claim being checked,
#     and a redirect means some other URL answered it. The redirect target itself is
#     never printed (INFRA-009): it is origin-controlled, and on the failure this check
#     is most likely to meet it is the configured origin echoing itself back. Only the
#     HTTP status code is reported, plus the fact that it was a redirect.
#   - The provenance sidecar can only ever add a failure because the bundle
#     match/drift decision is, and remains, served bytes vs `git show <ref>:<bundle>`
#     alone — the sidecar's repo_commit, its deployed_at, its claimed bundle sha256
#     values, and its mere presence are never the basis of that decision, only ever
#     reported alongside it.
#   - Both fetches restrict curl to `--proto '=http,https'` (INFRA-010/CER-021): the
#     origin is untrusted, and without this a `file://` (or other scheme) base URL
#     would turn this script into a local-file reader that reports "ok" against
#     whatever a caller planted at that path, never having made a network request at
#     all. Both fetches also pass a `--max-filesize` bound (16 MiB for a bundle,
#     64 KiB for the sidecar — see BUNDLE_MAX_BYTES/SIDECAR_MAX_BYTES below): without
#     one, an origin that streams an unbounded body with no `Content-Length` can hold
#     the scratch directory (and this script) for the whole --max-time budget. curl
#     >= 8.4 enforces `--max-filesize` mid-transfer, against the actual bytes received;
#     older curl only checks a declared `Content-Length` header up front, so an
#     unbounded stream with no such header runs to --max-time on those versions
#     instead of being cut short. This script does not gate on curl's version — the
#     dependency is documented here, not enforced.
#   - Every sidecar field this script prints is a *display copy*, never the raw
#     extracted value (INFRA-010/CER-026): the raw value is reduced with
#     `LC_ALL=C tr -dc` to the characters that field's own class allows (hex digits for
#     repo_commit and both sha256 claims, `[0-9TZ:-]` for deployed_at) and length-capped,
#     so a hostile sidecar cannot smuggle ANSI escape sequences, carriage returns, or
#     other control bytes into a report an operator reads and may paste into a
#     committed record. The emptiness check and the claimed-vs-served sha256 comparison
#     that decides exit 6 are always made on the *raw* value, never the display copy —
#     comparing the display copy would be exactly the proxy this script refuses: a
#     claim that sanitises to the correct hash is not the same claim as the correct
#     hash. When a display copy differs from its raw value, one fixed line says so;
#     that line never contains anything taken from the origin.
