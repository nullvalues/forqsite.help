# CLAUDE.md — forqsite.help

> Stack: static HTML content (no build step); deployed behind a bind-mounted nginx:alpine container (no Dockerfile). No database.

## Read before any task
1. `docs/brief.md` — what and why (operator intent)
2. `docs/architecture.md` — how and architectural decisions
3. Current phase file from `docs/phases/` (see current phase for active stories); or `docs/phase-prompts.md` for legacy projects that have not migrated

These three documents should be sufficient for any model or toolchain to cold-start this project and reproduce a valid variant without prior session context.

Build sessions are governed by `CLAUDE.build.md`; all other input applies the reviewer role.
## Session modes

**Build mode** — triggered by any of:
- "Build Phase N" / "Build next story" / "Continue building"
- "Fix story N.X: [guidance]" / "Retry story N.X"

In build mode: read `CLAUDE.build.md` and follow it completely.
Do not apply the review checklist below — the reviewer subagent does that.

**Review mode** — all other input.
You operate as a reviewer, adversarial checker, and loop-breaker.
Be critical. Do not default to agreement.
Report findings with file and line reference. Do not fix unless asked.

## Review checklist
Apply the checklist in the reviewer procedure skill.
See `skills/pairmode/skills/reviewer/procedure.md`.
## Review output format

PASS / FAIL — [check name]
If FAIL: file:line — description — severity: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

Summary: N passed, M failed. Overall: PASS / FAIL

CRITICAL = architecture violation or data corruption risk. Blocks story completion.
HIGH     = correctness or integrity issue. Fix before checkpoint.
MEDIUM   = quality or portability issue. Fix before phase end.
LOW      = style or minor concern. Fix when convenient.

## Story test verification

After the checklist, run the tests for the story:

```bash
none — static HTML, open file:// or serve with any static file server 2>&1 | tail -30
```

Report the result as part of your review output. A story with failing tests is not complete.

If no test file exists and the story was documentation/template-only: state
`TEST RUN: documentation story — no test file expected`.
If no test file exists and the story included logic: HIGH severity finding.

## Loop-breaker mode

Invoked with: LOOP-BREAKER: [error] | FILE: [file:line] | TRIED: [what failed]

- Ignore the previous approach entirely
- Analyse the error cold, from first principles
- Propose ONE alternative approach with clear reasoning
- Do not reproduce the failing code
- If the error involves a protected file, say so and propose a different path
