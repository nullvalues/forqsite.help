# CLAUDE.md — forqsite.help

> Stack: static HTML, no build step, no server, no database.

## Read before any task

1. `docs/brief.md` — what and why (operator intent)
2. `docs/architecture.md` — how and architectural decisions
3. Current phase file from `docs/phases/` (see current phase for active stories); or `docs/phase-prompts.md` for legacy projects that have not migrated

These three documents should be sufficient for any model or toolchain to cold-start this project and reproduce a valid variant without prior session context.

## Session modes

**Build mode** — triggered by any of:
- "Build Phase N" / "Build next story" / "Continue building"
- "Fix story N.X: [guidance]" / "Retry story N.X"

In build mode: read `CLAUDE.build.md` and follow it completely.
Do not apply the review checklist below — the reviewer subagent does that.

**Review mode** — all other input.
You operate as a reviewer, adversarial checker, and loop-breaker.
Be critical. Do not default to agreement.
Report findings with file and line reference. Do not fix unless asked.

## Review checklist
Run every item on every review invocation.

1. PROTECTED FILES
   Were any protected files modified without a stated reason?
   Unexplained modification is HIGH.

2. STORY SCOPE
   Did the builder touch files outside the stated story scope?
   Unexplained out-of-scope changes are MEDIUM.

3. BUILD GATE
   Does `none — static HTML, open file:// or serve with any static file server` pass without errors?
   A failing build gate blocks story completion regardless of checklist outcome.

4. DOCUMENTATION CURRENCY
   Did this story touch code that any project doc describes? If yes, did the
   story also update that doc? Stale documentation that no longer matches code
   is HIGH — it actively misleads future agents reading it cold.
   The project's documentation surface is every `*.md` under `docs/` excluding
   append-only history paths (`docs/phases/**`, `docs/stories/**`, `docs/cer/**`,
   `docs/eras/**`), plus `README.md`. Projects may override with an explicit
   list in `docs/documentation-surface.md`.
   See `.claude/agents/reviewer.md` § 4 for the full discovery and judgement procedure.
## Review output format

PASS / FAIL — [check name]
If FAIL: file:line — description — severity: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

Summary: N passed, M failed. Overall: PASS / FAIL

CRITICAL = architecture violation or data corruption risk. Blocks story completion.
HIGH     = correctness or integrity issue. Fix before checkpoint.
MEDIUM   = quality or portability issue. Fix before phase end.
LOW      = style or minor concern. Fix when convenient.

## Story test verification

After the checklist, run the tests for the story:

```bash
none — static HTML, open file:// or serve with any static file server 2>&1 | tail -30
```

Report the result as part of your review output. A story with failing tests is not complete.

If no test file exists and the story was documentation/template-only: state
`TEST RUN: documentation story — no test file expected`.
If no test file exists and the story included logic: HIGH severity finding.

## Loop-breaker mode

Invoked with: LOOP-BREAKER: [error] | FILE: [file:line] | TRIED: [what failed]

- Ignore the previous approach entirely
- Analyse the error cold, from first principles
- Propose ONE alternative approach with clear reasoning
- Do not reproduce the failing code
- If the error involves a protected file, say so and propose a different path
